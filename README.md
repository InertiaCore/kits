# InertiaCore Starter Kits

This repository contains examples of how to use [InertiaCore](https://github.com/kapi2289/InertiaCore), an [Inertia.js](https://inertiajs.com/) server-side adapter for .NET.

## Get Started

To create a new project using InertiaCore, run the following command:

```bash
npx @inertiacore/create@latest
```

This will create a new project with the name you provide.

You can choose between a React, Vue, or Svelte project.

## Run the project

Once you have created the project, you can run it using the following commands.

Run the following command to start the dotnet development server:

```bash
dotnet run
```

In another terminal, run the following command to start the React or Vue development server:

```bash
cd ClientApp
npm run dev
```

This will start the development server and you can access the application at `http://localhost:5266` or `https://localhost:7266` if you are using HTTPS.
